### 👋 Welcome to the official GitHub of John-Bot!
Hi there, well yes, we are on **GitHub**! After several decisions with the team, we decided to open our **GitHub** to gather our team of **developers**, **managers**, **supports** and **contributors**. You discover us on **GitHub**? No problem, **John-Bot** is a verified multipurpose Discord bot, used by 250,000 users (over 250 servers, thank you! ✨) Not satisfied? It includes many features: **moderation**, **entertainment**, **mini-game**, **information** and much **more**! 🏄 Add **John-Bot** to your Discord server now by clicking [here](https://add.johnbot.app).

### 💕 Thank you and support us
Namely, most of the people working in the team are not paid and running the John-Bot ecosystem is costly. That's why we have a Buy Me A Coffee. You are not obliged to make a donation, it is a gesture of support nothing less. No donation is forced by our team. 💗
